## Game planning
_In plain english - no code - think through how you'll make this game work. Example:_
+ _Create an array of two options, heads and tails._
+ _Randomly choose one of these options from the array and assign it as Player A's move_
+ _Assign Player B's move to whatever option was not chosen._
+ _Randomly choose from the array of heads/tails again and assign this as the "flip" value_
+ _If Player A's move matches "flip", then assign a value winner to Player A_
+ _Otherwise, assign a value winner to Player B_
+ _Report the results of Player A's Move, Player B's move, the flip, and the winner to the page_
